# Fitness-Portal-App
https://jira2.cerner.com/browse/DEVACDMY-36409

The project title is "Fitness Portal App". The user can register and can track their own activities by accessing the site. There is also a login page where an user can log in and access their profile. Going by the database schema there are tables namely, Registration Table, Profile Table and Activity Table. Registration Table is responsible for storing the user's credentials, Profile Table is responsible for storing all the user's details and Activity Table is responsible for tracking the user's fitness activity.

Database setup and installation : I have used MySQL Workbench in setting up the database. 

To install MySQL Workbench:
1. From an account with Administrator or Power User privileges, right-click the MSI file and select the Install item from the pop-up menu, or double-click the file.

2. In the Setup Type page, select either a Complete or Custom installation. To use all features of MySQL Workbench choose the Complete setup type.

3. Unless you choose otherwise, MySQL Workbench is installed in C:\%PROGRAMFILES%\MySQL\MySQL Workbench 8.0 edition_type\, where %PROGRAMFILES% is the default directory for programs for your locale. The %PROGRAMFILES% directory is defined as C:\Program Files\ on most systems.
